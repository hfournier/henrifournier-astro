Having spent 20 years developing software, I was feeling a little burnt out and uninspired. So when opportunity knocked, I opened the door and walked into the world of <Abbr title="Information technology">IT</Abbr> consulting. Like software development, IT requires that you constantly learn and expand your knowledge. Unlike software development, I found that IT work lacked the creative side where you could build something out of nothing but your imagination and skills.
