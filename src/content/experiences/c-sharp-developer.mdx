After Microsoft released [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework), it became apparent that [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) would be a better development option, so my evolution continued. By this time, I had relocated to Kelowna, BC, where I worked with other developers to launch <Abbr title="Thompson Okanagan dot NET User Group">TODNUG</Abbr> to share our knowledge with the community.
