With <Abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Computer Science">BSc (CS)</Abbr> from <Abbr title="University of New Brunswick">UNB</Abbr> added to the end of my name, I moved to Toronto and was employed as a [PL/1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I) and [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) programmer. Just over a year later, I was hired as a sub-contrator by an agency and assigned to various client projects. After anotheryear, I was self-employed as a contract programmer.
