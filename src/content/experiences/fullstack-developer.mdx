Yearning to get back to my software roots, I explored the rapidely evolving world of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)-based web development and settled on the <Abbr title="MongDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS">MEAN</Abbr> Stack. Since [Angular](https://angular.io/) is built on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), it made the transition from C# much easier, and compile-time type checking made for better websites. I eventually added [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) to the mix, because it is very Angular-like and is also based on TypeScript.
