The first computer program I wrote was in [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran), on [punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card), which were fed into a [card reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_711), and processed on the university's IBM mainframe. It was the longest time I have ever spent trying to add two numbers.
