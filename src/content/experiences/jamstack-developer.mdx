The evolution from [Full Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) to [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) wasn't a huge leap and one-click deployments to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) made life so much simpler. I thought that both [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)/[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) (with [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/)) were more nimble, intuitive and required much less boiler-plate coding than Angular. However, once I found [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), there was no turning back. The end result was lighter, faster, better web apps... and that's my jam.
