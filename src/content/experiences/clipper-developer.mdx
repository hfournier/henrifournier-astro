As <Abbr title="Personal Computers">PCs</Abbr> became more prevalent in the market place, I capitalized on my previous dBase skills and quickly learned to develop [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) applications in [Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)). I also became well versed in <Abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</Abbr> and spoke on the topic at international conferences.
