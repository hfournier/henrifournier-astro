	<p>
		With over 36 years of experience in software, I've done everything from programming mainframes
		to developing Jamstack websites and a whole lot of things in between. The fact that the
		landscape is always changing is part of what makes my work so interesting and challenging.
		There's always something new to learn and a problem to solve. Basically... I love a good puzzle.

			<Heading3>Jamstack Developer</Heading3>
			<p>
				The evolution from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack">Full Stack</a>
				to <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> wasn't a huge leap and one-click deployments
				to
				<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> made life so much simpler. I thought that both
				<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>/<a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>
				and
				<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy (11ty)</a>
				(with
				<a href="https://alpinejs.dev/">AlpineJS</a>) were more nimble, intuitive and required much
				less boiler-plate coding than Angular. However, once I found <a href="https://astro.build/"
					>Astro</a
				> with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>, there was no turning back. The
				end result was lighter, faster, better web apps... and that's my jam.

			<Heading3>Full Stack Developer</Heading3>
			<p>
				Yearning to get back to my software roots, I explored the rapidely evolving world of
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>-based web development and
				settled on the
				<Abbr title="MongDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS">MEAN</Abbr>
				Stack. Since
				<a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>
				is built on
				<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, it made the transition from C#
				much easier, and compile-time type checking made for better websites. I eventually added
				<a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a> to the mix, because it is very Angular-like and is also
				based on TypeScript.

			<Heading3>IT Consultant</Heading3>
			<p>
				Having spent 20 years developing software, I was feeling a little burnt out and uninspired.
				So when opportunity knocked, I opened the door and walked into the world of <Abbr
					title="Information technology">IT</Abbr
				> consulting. Like software development, IT requires that you constantly learn and expand your
				knowledge. Unlike software development, I found that IT work lacked the creative side where you
				could build something out of nothing but your imagination and skills.

			<Heading3>C# Developer</Heading3>
			<p>
				After Microsoft released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET</a>, it
				became apparent that
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a>
				would be a better development option, so my evolution continued. By this time, I had relocated
				to Kelowna, BC, where I worked with other developers to launch
				<Abbr title="Thompson Okanagan dot NET User Group">TODNUG</Abbr> to share our knowledge with
				the community.

			<Heading3>Delphi Developer</Heading3>
			<p>
				With Windows gaining momemtum, it was time to look for a new set of tools. Based on <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland">Object Pascal</a
				>,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal">Borland</a>'s
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)">Delphi</a>
				was the natural choice for me. Being ahead of the curve, I co-founded the
				<Abbr title="Toronto Area Delphi Developer Association">TaDDa!</Abbr> user group and presented
				on various topics to share my new found knowledge, which lead to more international conferences.

			<Heading3>Clipper Developer</Heading3>
			<p>
				As <Abbr title="Personal Computers">PCs</Abbr> became more prevalent in the market place, I capitalized

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS"> MS-DOS</a>
				applications in
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)">Clipper</a>. I also
				became well versed in
				<Abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</Abbr> and spoke on the topic at international
				conferences.

				With <Abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Computer Science">BSc (CS)</Abbr>

				added to the end of my name, I moved to Toronto and was employed as a
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I">PL/1</a>
				and
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> programmer. Just over a year later, I

			<Heading3>dBase III Programmer</Heading3>
			<p>
				When the university introduced a course in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase"
					>dBase III</a

				students. However, I managed to learn it on my own and became proficient enough to land
